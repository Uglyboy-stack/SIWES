            <b>Photography</b> is not just a hobbyâ€”it's a <strong>passion</strong> that allows me to express how I see the world.
            With every click, I try to capture the <em>emotion</em> and <u>beauty</u> of a moment. Whether it's a <span class="highlight">sunset over the mountains</span>
            or a candid smile, each photo tells a story.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of my favorite techniques is <span class="important"><strong>long exposure</strong></span>, which lets me play with light and motion in magical ways.
            It's an <em>art</em> that takes patience, but the results are always worth it.
